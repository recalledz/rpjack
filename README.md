🃏 Card Game – Incremental RPG Combat System

🔍 Overview

A dynamic card-based combat game where cards represent characters. Players battle against enemy cards (Dealers and Bosses), each possessing unique abilities, cooldowns, and visual effects. Inspired by blackjack and idle mechanics, the game emphasizes strategic deck building, progression, and resource management.

🧩 Key Features

Card-Based Stat and Level System: Classic cards—Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, and Spades—each with unique attributes and effects.

Job System: Unlock specialized roles for cards upon reaching level thresholds, with jobs determined by card suits.

Dealer and Boss Encounters: Face off against enemies with distinct abilities and escalating challenges.

Real-Time Combat Mechanics: Engage in battles with cooldown logic, ability overlays, and a combat tick system.

Healing Mechanics: Cards recover 1 HP after each enemy defeat.

Game Over Screen: A restart overlay appears when your deck is wiped out.
Click the Restart button or wait five seconds to respawn automatically.
Stats Screen: View lifetime progress and start a new run from the stats tab.

Progression Systems:

Stages and Worlds: Advance through stages, encountering bosses at milestones (e.g., stage 10) and progressing to new worlds with increased difficulty.

Auto-Attack: Activate automated attacks with adjustable speeds, influenced by card stats.

Prestige System: Reset progress for long-term benefits, including deck reshuffling, HP refill, and stage resets.


Resource Management:

Cash: Earned based on active card values and current stage/world.

Card HP per Kill: Each enemy defeated heals your cards.


Attributes and Stats:

Strength: Increases power and HP; reduces attack speed and ability accuracy.

Dexterity: Enhances ability accuracy, attack speed, and critical hits; decreases ability power.

Mind: Boosts ability power; reduces HP and strength.

Chaos: Amplifies critical damage and ability power.

Holy: Reduces cooldowns.


Jokers: Active abilities with cooldowns and limited slots.

Traits: Late-game mechanics where enemies possess special traits (e.g., double damage, shields) that can be inherited by player cards.

Interactive Star Chart: Drag star nodes to rearrange upgrade paths in real time.

> **Note**: This step requires network access to download packages. If Puppeteer's
> bundled browser fails to download, set `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` before
> running `npm install`.

🧪 Testing

Automated tests run with **Mocha** and **Chai** directly in Node.js. A GitHub Actions workflow triggers `npm test` on each push. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see **Installation**) before running:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are located in the `test/` directory.
