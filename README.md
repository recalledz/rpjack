🃏 Card Game – Incremental RPG Combat System

🔍 Overview

A dynamic card-based combat game where cards represent characters. Players battle against enemy cards (Dealers and Bosses), each possessing unique abilities, cooldowns, and visual effects. Inspired by blackjack and idle mechanics, the game emphasizes strategic deck building, progression, and resource management.

🧩 Key Features

Card-Based Stat and Level System: Classic cards—Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, and Spades—with no inherent suit bonuses.

Job System: Unlock specialized roles for cards upon reaching level thresholds, with jobs determined by card suits.

Dealer and Boss Encounters: Face off against enemies with distinct abilities and escalating challenges.

Real-Time Combat Mechanics: Engage in battles with cooldown logic, ability overlays, and a combat tick system.

Healing Mechanics: Cards recover 1 HP after each enemy defeat.

Game Over Screen: A restart overlay appears when your deck is wiped out.
Click the Restart button or wait five seconds to respawn automatically.
Stats Screen: View lifetime progress and start a new run from the stats tab.

Progression Systems:

Stages and Worlds: Advance through stages, encountering bosses at milestones (e.g., stage 10) and progressing to new worlds with increased difficulty.

Auto-Attack: Activate automated attacks with adjustable speeds, influenced by card stats.

Prestige System: Reset progress for long-term benefits, including deck reshuffling, HP refill, and stage resets.

Core Meditation: Mind, Body and Soul orbs fill from Life tab activities. They no longer gain XP from mana, healing or defeats during combat.
Constructs System: Combine resources to craft constructs (see docs/phrase-system.md).


Resource Management:

Cash: Earned based on active card values and current stage/world.

Card HP per Kill: Each enemy defeated heals your cards.


Attributes and Stats:

Strength: Increases power and HP; reduces attack speed and ability accuracy.

Dexterity: Enhances ability accuracy, attack speed, and critical hits; decreases ability power.

Mind: Boosts ability power; reduces HP and strength.

Chaos: Amplifies critical damage and ability power.

Holy: Reduces cooldowns.


Jokers: Active abilities with cooldowns and limited slots.

Traits: Late-game mechanics where enemies possess special traits (e.g., double damage, shields) that can be inherited by player cards.

Interactive Star Chart: Drag star nodes to rearrange upgrade paths in real time.


🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

Icons: Lucide Icons

Development Tools: Replit, GitHub integration, Codex-enabled development

Debug Panel: Toggleable tools for spawning enemies, adjusting stats, and now a fast mode to speed up time ticks during testing

Node Simulation: Run `node simulate.js [strategy]` to test upgrade progressions without a browser

🏹 Player & Global Upgrades

Upgrade Name	Base Value	Max Value	Cost Formula	Notes

Card Slots      3       ?       1000 * level^3	Increase the number of active cards
Global Damage Multiplier	1.0	?	200 * level^2	Amplify all damage dealt
Auto-Attack Speed	10000 ms	2000 ms	300 * level^2.2	Reduce time between automated attacks
Base Card HP        +3 per level   ?       100 * level^2   Enhance base HP for all cards
Card HP per Kill        1       ?       150 * level^2	HP recovered by cards after each kill


### Card Upgrade Mechanics

Clearing encounters can present a selection of upgrade cards. Each upgrade
applies immediately and can be purchased multiple times to stack its level.

- **Cost formula:** `100 * stage * world` multiplied by a rarity modifier.
  Rarity multipliers are 1× for common, 1.5× for uncommon, 2× for rare,
  and 3× for super‑rare upgrades.
- If none of the options are affordable, one upgrade is offered for free.
- **Prestige upgrades** appear only after resetting and focus on mana and other
  long‑term bonuses.

Examples include healing when cards are redrawn, extra card slots, and damage
or HP multipliers. For a deeper explanation, see
[docs/UPGRADES.md](docs/UPGRADES.md).

🃏 Card Progression

Stat	Scaling Formula	Notes

Damage	value * level	Base damage scales with card value and level
Max HP	value * level * baseHPMultiplier	HP influenced by card value, level, and attributes
Ability Power	Tied to attribute/stat	Determines potency of magical abilities
XP Requirement	XpReq = value * (level^2)	Higher value cards require more XP to level up

XP per Kill     (7/18) * L^2 / (1 + 0.007*(L-1))  L = stage + 10*(world-1)

### XP Calculation

Cards level up by defeating enemies. Two formulas keep the pace near
"one level per stage" for an average value card:

1. **Requirement** for level `L`

   `XpReq = value * (L^2)`

   Low-value cards reach higher levels quickly, while face cards require
   more grinding.

2. **XP award** when an enemy from stage `s` and world `w` is defeated

   ```
   L = s + 10 * (w - 1)
   XP = (7/18) * L^2 / (1 + 0.007 * (L - 1))
   ```

   `L` is the effective difficulty across worlds. Each new world adds 10
   levels to the scale. The small epsilon term increases kills needed by
   roughly one every few stages (e.g., stage 9 takes ~3m10s instead of 3m).

   For example, defeating a stage 5 enemy in world 1 (`L = 5`) grants about
   9.5 XP. Cards on the bench receive only half of this reward.

  Cards in the deck but not currently drawn gain only half of this XP.

### Power Gain per Level

Leveling up increases a card's offensive and defensive power by fixed amounts
before any attribute multipliers or upgrades are applied:

- **Damage** – `damage = baseDamage + 5 × (L - 1)`. Each level adds 5 points of
  damage on top of the value-based starting amount.
- **Max HP** – `maxHp = 5 × baseMultiplier + 5 × (L - 1)` (rounded). This yields
  5 additional maximum HP per level, scaled by the card's value and any bonuses.

The XP requirement for the next level is recalculated after each level-up using
`XpReq = value × L²`, so higher levels demand increasingly more XP.

📦 Installation

Install Node.js and fetch the project's dependencies. Puppeteer attempts to
download a bundled browser during installation, which may be blocked. Skip that
download by setting an environment variable when installing:

```bash
PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

🧪 Testing

Automated tests run with **Mocha** and **Chai** directly in Node.js. A GitHub Actions workflow triggers `npm test` on each push. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see **Installation**) before running:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are located in the `test/` directory.
