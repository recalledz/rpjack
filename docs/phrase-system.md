# Construct System

The phrase builder has been replaced with a simpler construct mechanic. The **Constructs** tab allows resources to be combined inside a small pot. When a valid recipe is present the *Construct* button crafts a card that can be slotted like the old phrases.

## Basics

- Drag available resources into the pot and press **Construct**.
- Recipes unlock as requirements are met.
- Crafted cards appear below the pot and must be equipped to provide their effect.
- Constructs may generate resources over time or provide buffs that modify production.
- Each construct has a **Potency** starting at 1.0. Voice level-ups increase all potencies by 5%.

### Starting Construct – Murmur

- Unlocked from the start.
- Costs: 25 Insight
- Produces 1 Sound and grants 1 Voice XP when cast.
- When activated, Murmur converts 1 Insight into 1 Sound.
- Cooldown: 1s. Your Sound resource can hold up to 200.
