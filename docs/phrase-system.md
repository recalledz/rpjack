# Construct System

The phrase builder has been replaced with a simpler construct mechanic. The **Constructs** tab allows resources to be combined inside a small pot. When a valid recipe is present the *Construct* button crafts a card that can be slotted like the old phrases.

## Basics

- Drag available resources into the pot and press **Construct**.
- Recipes unlock as requirements are met.
- Crafted cards appear below the pot and must be equipped to provide their effect.
- Constructs may generate resources over time or provide buffs that modify production.

### Starting Construct â€“ Murmur

- Unlocked from the start.
- Costs: 2 Insight
- Produces: 1 Sound and 1 Voice XP
- When slotted, Murmur converts Insight into Sound automatically.
